      <h2>Welcome to my profile section</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Rangga, I’m studying in Chaoyang University of Technology in Taiwan.
        This year is my second year, I’m majoring in information management. I’d like to
        explain some of my interests and hobbies as well. Actually I have a lot of interests,
        but there are some of them that I really liked the most. I like playing video games,
        coding, and doing digital drawing. I also like to travel, especially to places
        with beautiful scenery and rich culture. I enjoy exploring new places, trying local
        cuisines, and learning about different cultures.
